IBM Capstone Full Stack Cloud Development Capstone Project : 

Welcome to the exciting journey of my IBM Capstone Project! This endeavor was divided into several engaging steps, each contributing to the development and deployment of a robust application. 

This is a breakdown of the key milestones achieved during this immersive experience:

Step 1: Prework - Igniting the Spark
Embarked on the journey by creating my IBM Cloud account, a gateway to a world of possibilities.
Ignited the project by setting up a Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service, a powerful tool for unraveling the mysteries hidden in text.

Step 2: Fork, Build, and Deploy - Bringing Ideas to Life
Fostered collaboration and ownership by forking the project repository into my GitHub account.
Dived into the development environment, sculpting static pages to breathe life into the user stories.
Launched the application into the digital realm, deploying it on the IBM Cloud, making it accessible to the world.

Step 3: User Management and Beyond - Crafting a Personalized Experience
Empowered the application with user management capabilities, leveraging the Django authentication system.
Orchestrated a seamless development and deployment pipeline with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), ensuring a smooth journey for both developers and users.

Step 4: Backend Mastery - Weaving the Tapestry
Wove a backend tapestry by creating cloud functions for managing dealers and reviews, introducing scalability and modularity.
Sculpted Django models and views to manage car models and makes, laying the foundation for efficient data handling.
Established Django proxy services and views, seamlessly integrating dealers, reviews, and cars into a cohesive system.

Step 5: Dynamic Pages - Unleashing Interactivity
Ushered in a new era of user interaction with dynamic pages, creating a visually engaging user interface.
Invited users to explore a comprehensive page showcasing all dealers, making the experience both informative and delightful.
Opened the doors to valuable insights with a dedicated page for reviews, enabling users to dive deep into the world of automotive experiences.
Encouraged user engagement by providing a platform for adding reviews, turning every user into a valued contributor.

Step 6: Containerization - Elevating Accessibility
Elevated the application's accessibility by packaging it into a container, streamlining management and deployment.

This capstone project has been a beautiful adventure for myself, marked by efforts, innovation, and achievement.
