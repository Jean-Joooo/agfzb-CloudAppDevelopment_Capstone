IBM Capstone Full Stack Cloud Development Capstone Project : 

Welcome to the exciting journey of my IBM Capstone Project! This endeavor was divided into several engaging steps, each contributing to the development and deployment of a robust application. 

This is a breakdown of the key milestones achieved during this immersive experience:

Step 1: Prework - Igniting the Spark
Firstly, I had to set up my project, and I started to build somes static pages too, the path from some url on urls.py, and on views.py, and I have done some test to check if the server was running properly.
Then, I set up a Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) service, a powerful tool for unraveling the mysteries hidden in text.

Step 2: Build - Bringing Ideas to Life
Dived into the development environment, I take care of the user management, and I sculpted some static pages.
Set up CI/CD for my source code.

Step 3: User Management and Beyond - Crafting a Personalized Experience
Empowered the application with user management capabilities, leveraging the Django authentication system.
Sculpted more the models and views to manage car makes and car models, laying the foundation for efficient data handling.
Managed API's, and I created some functions to fetch well the data as per user request.

Step 4: Backend Mastery - Dynamic Pages - Unleashing Interactivity
Introduced scalability and modularity, and also integrate dealers, reviews, and cars into a cohesive system.
Invited users to explore a comprehensive page showcasing all dealers, making the experience both informative and delightful.
Opened the doors to valuable insights with a dedicated page for reviews, enabling users to dive deep into the world of automotive experiences.
Encouraged user engagement by providing a platform for adding reviews, turning every user into a valued contributor.

Step 5: Containerization - Elevating Accessibility
Elevated the application's accessibility by packaging it into a container, to streamline the management.

This capstone project has been a beautiful adventure for myself, marked by efforts, innovation, and achievement.
